Internet Archive. 1. BACKGROUND 1.1 Research in the History of the Web The Web is one of the most interesting artifacts of our time. For social scientists
it is a subject of study both for itself and for the manner in which it illuminates contemporary social phenomena. Yet a researcher who wishes to study the Web is faced with major difficulties. An obvious problem is that the Web is huge. Any study of the Web as a whole must be prepared to analyze billions of pages and hundreds of terabytes of data. Furthermore
the Web changes continually. It is never possible to repeat a study on the actual Web with quite the same data. Any snapshot of the whole Web requires a crawl that will take several weeks to gather data. Because the size and boundaries of the Web are ill defined
basic parameters are hard to come by and it is almost impossible to generate random samples for statistical purposes. But the biggest problem that social scientists face in carrying out Web research is historical
the desire to track activities across time. The Web of today can be studied by direct Web crawling
or via tools such as the Google Web API
