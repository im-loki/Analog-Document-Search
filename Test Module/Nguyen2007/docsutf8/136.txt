ABSTRACT
Public administrations of all over the world invest an enormous 
amount of resources in e-government. How the success of e-government
can be measured is often not clear. E-government 
involves many aspects of public administration ranging from 
introducing new technology to business process (re-)engineering. 
The measurement of the effectiveness of e-government is a 
complicated endeavor. 
In this paper current practices of e-government measurement are 
evaluated. A number of limitations of current measurement 
instruments are identified. Measurement focuses predominantly 
on the front (primarily counting the number of services offered) 
and not on the back-office processes. Interpretation of measures 
is difficult as all existing measurement instruments lack a 
framework depicting the relationships between the indicators and 
the use of resources. The different measures may fit the aim of the 
owners of the e-governmental services, however, due to 
conflicting aims and priorities little agreement exists on a uniform 
set of measures, needed for comparison of e-government 
development. Traditional methods of measuring e-government 
impact and resource usage fall short of the richness of data 
required for the effective evaluation of e-government strategies.

INTRODUCTION
Public institutions as well as business organizations use the 
Internet to deliver a wide range of information and services at an 
increasing level of sophistication [24]. However, Web sites and 
related business processes and information systems are so 
complex that it is difficult for governments to determine adequate 
measures for evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the 
spending of their public money.  Moreover only measuring the 
front of public websites is a too narrow view on e-government. E-government
involves the collaboration and communication 
between stakeholders and integration of cross-agency business 
processes. 
An important aim of having a well-funded theory on measuring e-government
is to allow comparison or benchmarking. By 
examining the results of such benchmarks we might be able to 
distinct good from bad practices and to give directives to 
designers of e-governmental services. Moreover is should help to 
identify how effective public money is spend. Thus evaluating the 
relationship between results and resources used. 
Comparison can have different goals. Selecting between options 
is just one of them. Principally we can distinct three types of 
comparison: 1) comparison of alternatives (e.g. to make a choice 
between alternative solutions), 2) vertical comparison over time 
(e.g. in order to measure improvement of versions) and 3) 
horizontal comparison (e.g. benchmarking different solutions). 
Whatever type of comparison we choose, we can only compare if 
we have a set of preferred outcomes. Many measurement 
instruments currently applied are not described in such way that 
the preferences underlying the instrument have been made 
explicitly. In this research we describe different measurement 
instruments used and we will discuss their strengths and 
weaknesses. 
The  goal of this paper is to evaluate how current measurement 
instruments the impact of e-government. The combined research 
methodology of literature research and case study was chosen to 
answer the goal of this research. Case study research can be 
characterized as qualitative and observatory, using predefined 
research questions [36]. Case studies were used to examine 
existing measurement instruments in the Netherlands. The e-government
monitor of Accenture and a European Union 
measurement instrument was also evaluated as thes instruments 
are used by Dutch agencies to benchmark their situation.

THE NATURE OF E-GOVERNMENT
Before analyzing instruments developed to measure e-government 
development, it is necessary to understand the nature of e-government
. The organization of public administration involves 
many, heterogeneous types of business processes. When law or 
regulations are changed these processes and their supportive 
systems have to be adapted. Within one policy layer the process 
of adaptation starts with legislation drafting (adapting the law or 
regulations) followed by a chain of processes varying from 
translating these law texts into specifications, design of processes 
and supporting systems, development of these processes and 
systems and finally implementation and use (for a recent `legal 
engineering' approach see [34]). A complicating factor is that 
more than one governmental layer exists and often interaction 
between these layers occurs. Especially the need to adapt 
legislation from the European Union is a more then ever dominant 
factor that even further complicates this process is. 
In Figure 1 the fragmented nature of the government is shown. 
Legislation and service provisioning efforts are distributed over 
the European, State, Region and local level. The situation is even 
more complicated as within each level many agencies of various 
types exists. At a local level municipalities, water boards, 
chambers of commerce, local taxes and many other public and 
public-private agencies exists. As such many agencies influence 
the impact of e-government and measurement should include 
them all.

Figure 1: Fragmented nature of public administration 
 
Two main types of interactions influence this fragmented 
landscape, the policy-making, implementation, execution and 
enforcement of new legislation and the business and citizens 
searching for information and services.  
We will denote the creation, implementation, execution, 
enforcement and maintenance of laws as production cycle in this 
paper. Governments are looking for ways to increase their 
efficiency, effectiveness, decrease the administrative burden and 
reduce the lead times for adopting new legislations. The 
consequences of new laws at production phase (drafting) are only 
roughly known. Only after implementing the new regulations in 
the processes and supporting systems the full meaning of applying
these regulations becomes clear. Certainly when the 
interpretations and translation into practical applications take 
place at local government level it often will not be possible to 
timely inform the businesses or citizens, who are affected by the 
new law, pro-actively, as no information about concrete effects on 
their cases is available. A complicating factor is that many times a 
administrative process is supported by heterogeneous information 
systems and many different parties can be involved in adapting 
those systems. 
Most of the companies' ERP software components need to be 
updated quite frequently to be in, and keep being in accordance 
with small changes in administrative legislation. The same holds 
for Human Resources software, Time reporting software, Tax 
reporting software and, more indirectly, Logistics software. All 
have to be updated due to changes in legislation. It does not 
require extensive explanation to stress the need for smart public-private
networks from a production chain perspective.  
Nowadays businesses expect that the governments reduce the 
administrative burden for businesses. Governments can achieve 
this goal by creating a smart, service oriented, public 
administration. To be able to provide these integrated services 
access to different legal sources or better to the formal models 
that could be derived from those models is needed (see e.g. [7]). 
Standardization initiatives like the Metalex standard for 
describing legal sources (see
www.metalex.nl
) and the Power
method for modeling normative systems (see
www.belastingdienst.nl/epower
) are essential first steps towards
this. They provide a basis for interoperable and contextual better 
understandable and accessible legal sources that could easier be 
connected to the context of business activities. 
From the demand perspective, citizens and businesses find it very 
hard to access relevant legislation, local procedures and rules, 
policy documents etc. Governmental bodies are engaged in a 
flurry of policy and law making activities. Not only is this a 
complex myriad of legal issues, but the information is produced at 
different levels of public administration, including local, regional, 
national and European union. A commonly accepted requirement 
however is that online state legislative information is equally 
accessible to all (Fage & Fagan, 2004) and of course in the first 
place it should be accessible. Many governments currently are 
searching for ways to make their information accessible and 
retrievable. This involves issues regarding terminology, 
explaining the type of legislative document, understandable and 
easy-to-use search interfaces and accessing the official status of 
online documents. 
A central question for researchers working in the field of e-government
is how to measure the progress made in complying to 
the requirements mentioned before. In this paper we examine 
some examples of measurement instruments that were developed 
to measure progress in e-Government. But before describing these 
instruments we will discuss some literature on measuring eGovernment
first.
LITERATURE REVIEW
There is a diversity of literature focusing on measurements. Stage 
models are often used to positioning and evaluate the current 
status of e-government development. Services literature focusing

482
on the measurement to of perceived quality, satisfaction of 
complex, multi-service organizations. Last there is the research 
focusing on developing suitable `yardstick', performance 
indicators acting as surrogates for measuring the performance.
3.1 Stage models
Many researchers on e-business address the stages of Web site 
development. Green [17] suggests three stages: attracting, 
transforming, and utilization of media technology. Fink et al. 
(2001) focuses on attracting, enhancing and retaining client 
relationships using the Web site applications. Moon [27]proposes 
a five stage model. Layne and Lee [23] propose four stages of a 
growth model towards e-government. In stage one, governments 
create a `state website' by establishing a separate Internet 
department. There is no integration between the processes in the 
front and back offices. The web sites are focused on creating a 
web-presence and providing information. Transaction possibilities 
for customers are restricted to printing online forms and sending 
them by traditional mail. At stage two, transaction, there is two-way
communication. Customers transact with government on-line 
by filling out forms and government responds by providing 
confirmations, receipts, etc. The number of transactions is 
relatively small and the organization becomes confronted with 
translating information from and back to the front office and the 
other way around. Often a working database is established in the 
front office for supporting immediate transactions. The data in 
this database is periodically derived from and exported to the 
various databases in the back office. At stage three, vertical 
integration, the focus is moving towards transformation of 
government services, rather than automating and digitizing 
existing processes. Most information systems are localized and 
fragmented. Government organizations often maintain separate 
databases that are not connected to other governmental agencies 
at the same level or with similar agencies at the local or federal 
level. A natural progression according to Layne and Lee is the 
integration of scattered information systems at different levels 
(vertical) of government services. Layne and Lee (2001) expect 
that vertical integration within the similar functional walls but 
across different levels of government will happen first, because 
the gap between levels of government is much less than the 
difference between different functions. Information systems are 
connected to each other or, at least, can communicate with each 
other. 
The problem with the description of governmental systems is that 
they don't make a distinction between the (legal and 
administrative `knowledge' contained in those systems and the 
data (of citizens) to which that knowledge is applied (e.g. to 
derive if someone is entitled to receive a subsidy). Especially the 
sharing of data is limited and for very good reasons too! Both the 
desire to guarantee a certain level of privacy and the vulnerability 
for misuse of data have been reasons for the legislator to limit 
storage, reusing and sharing data between different agencies (not 
to speak of passing data of citizens from the government to 
private institutions). 
The challenge consequently is how to realize the full potential of 
information technology, from the customer's perspective, since 
this can only be achieved by horizontally integrating government 
services across different functional walls (`silos') in Layne and 
Lee's stage four, horizontal integration. The question is how to 
achieve this without the need for having databases across different 
functional areas to communicate with each. The situation that
information obtained by one agency can be used for CRM 
purposes by other agencies by sharing information is for reasons 
mentioned earlier, undesirable. The knowledge contained in these 
information systems however can be shared and reused thus 
allowing better integrated government services.
3.2 Service literature
The concepts of perceived quality and satisfaction are two of the 
fundamental pillars of recent evaluation studies. Bign√© et al. [5] 
conclude that in most cases the fundamental unit of analysis has 
been an isolated service, and the fact that several services may be 
offered by an individual organization has not been taken into 
account. Indeed multi-service organizations, where the customer 
has access to several services, have not been so intensively dealt 
with. The problems facing these organizations in terms of 
measurement and management of perceived quality and of 
satisfaction are more complex than in those organizations where 
only one service is offered, but less complex then situations where 
a service has to be assembled from many other service suppliers. 
When measuring the quality of such integrated service it is 
necessary to take into consideration not only the perceived quality 
of each of the elementary services, but also the perceived overall 
quality of the constituting ones. 
Bign√© et al. [5] found that the scale used to determine the 
perceived quality of the core services of hospitals, and 
universities, is composed of five dimensions, as proposed by 
Parasuraman et al. [28]: tangibility, reliability, responsiveness, 
confidence and empathy.


3.3 Performance indicators
Performance indicators serve as surrogates to deduce the quality 
of the e-government performance [20]. Lee [24] provides 
measurements based on development states and a modification of 
Simeon's [32]components.  
(1) The following five items determine the affect (Attracting) of a 
homepage on the Web site:
1.  Design of logo and tagline (quick summary of what a
Web site is all about).
2.  Graphics (e.g. layout, color and figures of a homepage). 
3. Institution's
self-advertising (e.g. banner, button, and
interstitials).
4.  Services for attracting (e.g. quiz, lottery, e-card, maps,
weather, channels, download service).C
5.  Contents for attracting (e.g. entertainments, culture,
tourism, game, kids, health, gallery).
(2)  Informing  consists of nine items developed by modifying 
Simeon's (1999) components: local links, contents for publicity, 
contents for learning, reports, descriptions on the institution, 
descriptions on online administrative services, projects, contact 
information and counseling. 
(3) Community consists of ten items: online forum, events, partner 
links (or ads), e-Magazine (or newsletter or Webcast), message 
boards, users' participation (e.g. articles, photos, personal links), 
focus of news, vision (or values), domain identity and community 
services (or online support for community meeting or 
networking). A good example of the latter is the ``Citizen 
discussion room'' of Ulsan City (eulsan.go.kr).

483
(4)  Delivering  as a variable is determined by the presence or 
absence of features like: search engine, mailing list, framework, 
multimedia, password system, FAQ, chat, downloadable 
publications and update indication. 
(5) Innovation. Public institutions have to utilize the Internet for 
actual service innovation. Hence, two variables indicating 
innovation results are selected: transformation level of existing 
services and frequency of new innovative services. These are each 
rated on a five-point scale: ``(1) never; (2) only descriptions; (3) 
online request; (4) partial; (5) full processing'' for the first item 
and'' (1) never to (5) many new systems'', for the second item. 
Such quantification is possible because the introduction of new 
innovative systems on public sector Web sites is growing, for
example, Docket Access, View Property Assessments, and 
Request for Proposals of Philadelphia (phila.gov) and Citizen 
Assessment Systems, Citizen Satisfaction Monitor, Online 
Procedures Enhancement (OPEN) System of Seoul 
(metro.seoul.kr). 
These measures focus mainly on components visible to users and 
do not take into account back-office components like integration.  
Van der Merwe and Bekker [26] classify website evaluation 
criteria in 5 groups as shown in table1. Many of their criteria 
seem to be inspired by their e-Commerce orientation but many of 
the criteria will be applicable to e-Government as well.

MEASUREMENTS INSTRUMENTS FOUND IN PRACTICE
Hazlett and Hill discuss [19] discuss the current level of 
government measurement. Huang and Chao (2001) note that 
while the development and management of web sites are 
becoming essential elements of public sector management, little is 
known about their effectiveness. Indeed, Kaylor et al. (2001) note 
that research into the effectiveness of e-Government efforts tends
to concentrate on content analysis or measures of usage. These 
may not be wholly appropriate metrics with which to gauge 
success. Aspects of service relevant in this context may, 
according to Voss (2000) include: consumer perceptions of 
security and levels of trust; response times (bearing in mind that 
Internet consumers may well be accustomed to quick responses); 
navigability of the Web site; download time; fulfillment of service 
promised; timely updating of information; site effectiveness and 
functionality. Reinforcing a point made above, Voss (2000) takes 
the view that e-service channels should be regarded as providing

484
support for front-line service delivery and not replacements for 
front-line service. However, such channels do enable change in 
the nature of front-line service delivery and of human 
involvement in service.
4.1 OVERHEID.NL
The Dutch Government has recently published "Overheid.nl 
Monitor 2003", its fifth annual e-government progress report. 
While highlighting a number of encouraging developments, the 
report concludes that much remains to be done in areas such as 
user-friendliness, transactional services and e-democracy. 
Overheid.nl focused on all government agencies, and mentions 
the following agencies explicitly.
¬∑
Municipalities
¬∑
Ministries
¬∑
Provinces
¬∑
Water boards
A screenshot of the online monitor of the measurement of 
municipalities is shown in the figure below.

Figure 2: Screenshot of Overheid.nl 
 
"Overheid.nl Monitor 2003: developments in electronic 
government" is based on a periodical large-scale survey of 
government websites, which was carried out in October 2003 by 
Advies Overheid.nl on behalf of the Dutch Ministry of the Interior 
and Kingdom Relations. The survey assessed 1,124 government 
websites according to five criteria: user-friendliness, general 
information, government information, government services, and 
scope for participation (interactive policy making). The website 
user friendliness measurement etc, is very thorough in this survey. 
The e-service measurement is less well defined. The services 
investigated for the survey are listed clearly for several layers of 
government but they seem to be limited to the so called `Dutch 
service product catalogue', set of typical municipal products and 
services.
Figure 3: Sample listing of services measured and ways 
of accessing them investigated  
Additionally, researchers measured the e-mail response time of 
government websites and assessed user satisfaction via a survey 
of 3,000 users. The report states that, although e-government 
services are developing on schedule and are becoming more 
sophisticated, there is still much room for improvement. 
On the positive side, the report finds that:
E-government is developing on schedule. The 2003 target of 
providing 35% of government services electronically was 
widely achieved, with 39% of services for citizens and 44% of 
services for businesses e-enabled by October 2003.
However, the report also identifies a number of shortcomings and 
areas where improvement is needed: 
Practically no full electronic transactions are available. In this 
respect, the report considers that development of such services 
will depend both on future solutions for user identification and 
authentication and on back-office re-engineering.  
Although the use of e-services is growing, the development of e-government
is still mainly supply-driven and the penetration of 
government websites remains unknown. "Only if we assess the 
penetration of government websites and the level of their use can 
we take a truly demand-driven approach", the report says.
The items related to municipalities are connected to the functionalities 
within an implemented product and services catalogue.  
 
D1
Is a product catalogue or another form of systematically 
offered services been used?

D2
-if so, does at least contain 150 products?
D3
-if so, does is at least contain 50 forms? 
i.e.: can one request for  or comment on at least 50 product 
by using a form that is contained in the product catalogue 
which can be filled in, printed and send in by the users ...?
D4
-if so, can these be accessed per life event?
D5
-if so, can these be accessed per theme?
D6
-if so, can these be accessed by using a lexicon (a-z)?
D7
-if so, does it contain a specific search function? (fill in the 
search term)
Besides this, four commonly municipal products are mentioned that can 
be supplied more or less in a digital form.
(choices: no info; info; down loadable form; up loadable 
form; transaction)
D8a
Request for building permission
D8b
Request for Cutting trees permission
D8c
Request for extract from GBA
D8d
Report of change of address /  removal (no  transaction 
possible)

485
Users' satisfaction with e-government services is still 
significantly lower than with services delivered through 
traditional channels.
E-democracy tools and citizen engagement through electronic 
means remain embryonic. According to the report, this is due not 
only to a lack of demand but also to a poorly organized supply 
side, with inadequate moderation, unappealing consultation 
subjects and missing follow-up. 
In addition to identifying progress accomplished and remaining 
issues, the report makes a number of recommendations that 
should help reach the objectives of the Andere Overheid ("Other 
Government") action programme, presented in December 2003. 
Such recommendations include the following:
E-government services must become more user-friendly and 
easier to find. Metadata standards should be defined to make 
them easier to find through search engines. FAQs and lists of 
the most searched terms and documents should also be made 
more widely available.
E-government services must be permanently improved: even once 
all government websites are fully functional, government should 
still constantly aim to improve e-government and consult target 
groups about new services they might require, says the report.  
E-government must be further developed through service 
integration across government bodies, which is currently still in 
its infancy. According to the report, the Dutch supply-driven 
approach has so far sought solutions within the limits and 
administrative competencies of single bodies.  
Emphasis must be shifted from the breadth of services to their 
depth. Rather than aiming to run every electronic product and 
service conceivable, government bodies should aim to integrate 
services as deeply as possible, especially those in frequent and 
popular demand, the report says. This implies developing 
seamless links from the front to the back office and fostering a 
more customer-minded culture.  
From the perspective of the policymakers we may conclude that 
the benchmark takes into account individual agencies and their 
websites, number of services and to a certain degree also service 
levels, but the aim is to integrate horizontally, something which is 
not measured by
www.overheid.nl
.
4.2 WEBDAM.NL
In the year 2000 the ministry of interior decided that all 
municipalities should be online by 2002 and 25% of the services 
provisioning should be support by websites. In order to help 
municipalities to achieve this, the Webdam project was started in 
March 2000 aiming at stimulating municipalities to develop 
websites. These websites should deliver better and improved 
services provisioning over the Internet as citizens expected.  
One of the activities in the Webdam project has been the 
development of a website that allowed municipalities to share 
knowledge and make better use of the Internet. To further 
stimulate municipalities Webdam started a Top 50 for 
municipalities' websites, using criteria such as design, content, 
service level and communication. Assessment and ranking of each 
municipality is performed by representatives coming from three 
groups; civil servants, citizens and experts. 
Webdam uses a panel of experts to judge the public agencies' web 
pages. The stakeholders include the following groups:
1.
Webdam employees (experts)

2.  Public servants municipality under study  
3. ¬≠Citizens

These stakeholders judges the web pages based on fie main 
groups
1. Layout,

2. Content, 
3. Communication,

4. services
and,
5.
plus/minus remarks

Each group has a minimum and maximum score. The total is 
aggregated to determine a ranking. ¬∑Who determines score?

Webdam focuses exclusively on the front-office, the aspects

4.3  Accenture e-gov monitor
The yearly research conduct by Accenture [1][2][3] has a 
profound influence on governments. An increase of decrease in 
ranking of this report results in discussions about the future of e-government
. 
Accenture researchers in each of the 23 selected countries 
described the typical services that national government should 
provide using the Internet in order to fulfill the obvious needs of 
citizens and businesses. They accessed and assessed the websites 
of national government agencies to determine the quality and 
maturity of services, and the level at which business can be 
conducted electronically with government.
In total, 169 national government services across nine major 
service sectors were investigated by Accenture during a two 
weeks lasting study (!)

in 2002 using the web in 23 countries. The
nine service sectors researched were Human Services, Justice & 
Public Safety, Revenue, Defence, Education, Transport & Motor 
Vehicles, Regulation & Democracy, Procurement and Postal. The 
main "indicator" of the eGovernment level chosen by Accenture

486
is what they call: service maturity. Service maturity is an 
indication for the level to which a government has developed an 
online presence. It takes into account the numbers of services for 
which national governments are responsible that are available 
online (Service Maturity Breadth), and the level of completeness 
with which each service is offered (Service Maturity Depth). 
Service Maturity Overall is the product of Service Maturity 
Breadth and Service Maturity Depth.
Service maturity is decomposed into the following aspects:
Publish - Passive/Passive Relationship. The user does not 
communicate electronically with the government agency and the 
agency does not communicate (other than through what is 
published on the website) with the user. 
Interact - Active/Passive Interaction. The user must be able to 
communicate electronically with the government agency, but the 
agency does not necessarily communicate with the user. 
Transact - Active/Active Interaction. The user must be able to 
communicate electronically with the government agency, and the 
agency must be able to respond electronically to the user. the 
degree to which the services are organized around the citizen, as 
opposed to around internal government structures.
In 2004 Accenture again investigated 12 service sectors and 206 
services in yet again two weeks. They were: a
