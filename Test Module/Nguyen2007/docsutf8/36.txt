Analysis of Soft Handover Measurements in 3G Network
ABSTRACT
A neural network based clustering method for the analysis
of soft handovers in 3G network is introduced. The method
is highly visual and it could be utilized in explorative analysis
of mobile networks. In this paper, the method is used
to find groups of similar mobile cell pairs in the sense of
handover measurements. The groups or clusters found by
the method are characterized by the rate of successful handovers
as well as the causes of failing handover attempts.
The most interesting clusters are those which represent certain
type of problems in handover attempts. By comparing
variable histograms of a selected cluster to histograms of
the whole data set an application domain expert may find
some explanations on problems. Two clusters are investigated
further and causes of failing handover attempts are
discussed.

(SHO). Soft handover makes it possible to have connections
on several base stations (BS) simultaneously.
In this paper, a set of measurements which can be used for
soft handover decision making are analyzed and compared
with other measurements in which statistics of successful-ness
of handover attempts have been collected. We do not
know exactly the parameters of used SHO algorithm. SHOs
are investigated only on basis of data set and some general
knowledge of 3G systems. Mobile cell pairs with handovers
(HO) are divided in groups using clustering algorithm. Cell
pairs in which SHOs are similar with each other fall in same
group. Different types of SHO failures are analyzed using
clustering information and distributions of measurements in
each cluster.
In Section 2 the soft handover concept, the measurements
and used neural network algorithm are shortly introduced.
Analysis methods which have been used are described in
Section 3. Preliminary results are shown and discussed in
Section 4. Finally, some conclusions are drawn in the last
section.
BACKGROUND
In this section, the basics of soft handover in 3G network
is explained and the available data set is introduced. Neural
network algorithm used in data clustering is also presented.
2.1
Soft handover
Soft handover is a state of MS being connected to several
BSs simultaneously. In GSM networks, a fixed threshold for
handover from one cell to another is used. In 3G networks,
each MS is connected to a network via a set of BSs called
active set. Members of active set are updated on basis of
measurements made by MS. The advantage of having connections
on several BS simultaneously is realized when MS
is moving towards another BS, the MS should have a connection
at least on one BS all the time. In GSM system, the
older connection has to be terminated before the new one
can be setup. The connection setup phases are the most
vulnerable steps in a call. The connection between MS and
BS is setup in a beginning of a call or later when handover
occurs. If the setup is not successful, it is useful to have an
existing connection to another BS or otherwise the call will
be abnormally terminated.
Handover can occur due to signal quality reasons or when
the traffic capacity in a cell has reached its maximum or is
approaching it. In the latter case, traffic load in the network
can be distributed more uniformly by handing over some
users from the most crowded cells. The above method is
330
called cell breathing. Use of cell breathing without giving
the information to the analyzer increases the complexity of
the analysis and can mix up a lot in the analysis process.
For a user soft handover means power saving (in uplink)
and less abnormally terminated calls. For an operator lower
MS transmitting powers mean less interference. When MS
is in SHO, several BSs listen the same uplink channel, but
all BSs have their own downlink channel. The offered diversity
is resource consuming in downlink direction. There is
a tradeoff between better QoS in mobility management and
consumption of resources.
Decision of soft handover is made in mobile station by
comparing the signal-to-noise ratios of active and candidate
BSs Common Pilot Channel (CPICH) [2]. Members of active
set are selected on basis of powers of this pilot signal [5,
12, 16].
BSs which are not in the active set but next from it in the
sense of measured quantity are in candidate set. Candidate
set BSs are constantly monitored whether their offer better
connection than cells in active set. Cells not in active or
candidate set are monitored less frequently whether their
can enter the candidate set.
Cell is either added to the
active set if the maximum amount of cells in the active set
is not reached or cell replaces the cell which offers the lowest
quality connection. Cells which are no more able to offer
a connection which is good enough are removed from the
active set.
Thresholds are used in adding, replacing and removing
BSs from active set by BSs in candidate set to avoid ping
pong effect. This means that a value of measured quantity
should be with a certain threshold better than the old one
for changing cells in active set. If measurement which is only
slightly better (i.e. with zero threshold) is enough for changing
cells in sets, it is quite possible that the same change is
performed in opposite direction very soon. Thus, the original
update of the set was useless and resource consuming in
the sense of all required signaling.
2.2
Data
Three data sets of Key Performance Indicator (KPI) level
measurements related on handover events are saved. Each
set consists of measurements collected during one hour. KPI
is considered as an important measure to be followed. It can
be a measurement by itself or it has been computed from a
group of raw counters [10]. One data vector consists of probabilities
, means, sums and counters computed over one hour
of one source target cell pair. Here, source refers on cell
in active set and target on another cell which is measured
and possibly added in active or candidate set.
Measurements
of target cell are compared with those of source cell.
Handover decisions are made in MS on basis of measured
and computed base stations received signal signal-to-noise
ratios (E
c
/N
0
). For each source and target cell pair mean
of signal-to-noise ratio differences is computed using
EcnoDiffMean = mean n[E
c
/N
0
]
target
- [E
c
/N

]
source
o .
Mean value and number of made comparisons (EcnoDiffNum)
are saved. Four bin pdfs of these measurements are also
stored with bin centers in -6, -3, 0 and 3dB, correspond-ingly
.
In addition to E
c
/N
0
measurements, averages of received
pilot signal power ratios between BS pairs (av rscp ratio)
have been computed and stored in database. The time and
probability of being in SHO with each other have also been
measured. Time of target and source cell being in SHO with
each other simultaneously is counted in variable t act. Then,
at least one MS is in SHO having both source and target cell
in its active set. The measurement is symmetric for a switch
of source and target cells. Time of target cell being in SHO
with source cell is stored in t act dir. Cell total time in
SHO is saved in tot time sho. It has been counted over all
the targets of fixed source cell. Probability of target and
source being in same active set is stored in variable p act.
Total number of SHO attempts to add target to active
set is stored in SHO total att. Ratio of successful SHO attempts
which lead to addition of target cell in active set is
saved in add ratio. In addition to those above, the number
of SHO failures is stored in pfail total and ratios of four
different failure causes are saved. Failure occurs in setup
or active time phase of SHO and it is either radio channel
problem or not. Probability of cell being in monitored state
is also measured (p4th 5th). All the measurements used in
the analysis are shortly described in Table 1.
A lot of data has been saved in data sets, but also some
very important information is missing. Due to missing information
on cell capacities, their locations and performed
manual and automatic tuning operations on network configuration
between successive data set saves, only preliminary
analysis can be performed. The rest of the analysis process
is described on theoretical level.
2.3
Self-Organizing Map
Self-Organizing Map (SOM) [8] is an unsupervised neural
network algorithm which adapts the codebook vectors
of neurons so that they approximate the input data distribution
. When the training has converged topological areas
or domains corresponding to certain types of inputs can be
found from the map. The topology and the size of the network
is fixed before adaptation.
In the SOM algorithm, the codebook vectors w
j
of the
SOM are at first initialized. Then, the following steps are
repeated for each input vector x: Find the index of best-matching
or nearest codebook vector using
i(x) = argmin||x - w
j
||,
in which j goes through all the neurons in the map. Next,
the codebook vectors of winner neuron and its neighbors are
updated using
w
j
(t + 1) = w
j
(t) + h
ij
(x)(x(t) - w
j
(t)).
Here,  is the learning rate and h
ij
(x) is the neighborhood
function centered around the winner neuron. Input sample
x defines the winner neuron and the topological distance
between indexes i and j defines how much the neuron is
updated. Neighborhood function is typically Gaussian or
bubble function i.e. function which decrease monotonically
and even goes to zero when the distance increases.
In this paper, a batch version of the SOM algorithm is
used. In batch SOM, all codebook vectors of the SOM are
computed after the best-matching units of all input data
vectors have been found. The same data set is used several
times.
METHODS
Handover related measurement from 3G network can be
analyzed using standard data mining methods [1]. In this

Variable defined in the analysis.
study, methods presented in Figure 1 are used. At first,
the miner have to decide what could be interesting in this
data. The analysis task has to be defined. On basis of that
the first choice of variables will be done. Next, the selected
variables are preprocessed, in order to be able to use them
in later analysis.
In data mining tasks, variable selection and preprocessing
are the most critical phases, because in this step the miner
decides which variables are important and how should they
be processed. The whole data mining process consists of several
cycles performed repeatedly. The cycles include testing
how different variable selections and preprocessing methods
effect on final results. The process has inner loops in which
some tasks or parameters are fixed on basis of selections
made in outer loop. The inner loops are performed more
frequently. Loops with more general task like the definition
of mining task are repeated less frequently. When the
mining task is defined the analyzer should be able to decide
what is (s)he looking out for.
Now, the analysis task is defined as finding groups of sim-ilarly
behaving cell pairs in SHO situations. Importance of
measurements can also be highlighted using proper weighting
of variables. In addition to clustering, also other tasks
for data analysis can be defined. One possibility is to try to
find cells or cell pairs with anomalous behavior. Anomalies
can also be found by clustering, but expert knowledge in
variable selection and preprocessing steps are very important
.
Using different variables, preprocessing methods and weighting
of variables different clustering results can be found. To
find out which of them is useful, interpretation of clusters is
needed. This can be done using histograms or rules defined
by data samples falling in clusters. The results which have
been found using clustering methods should be visualized
together with spatial locations to be able to understand the
usefulness of results. Methods should be performed repeatedly
to analyze successive data sets under the knowledge of
performed tuning operations. Thus, there is a possibility to
find explanations to changing results. In this study, results
of only one data set are shown, because more information
on application domain is needed to be able to combine and
compare successive clustering results.
3.1
Preprocessing
Different preprocessing methods have been tested. The
final method was selected on basis of histograms and the
clusters which were found using the selected method. At
the first step, the distributions are truncated. Outliers in
the selected variables were replaced by their maximum permitted
values. Two variables, pfail total and EcnoDiffNum,
were scaled using the number of performed soft handover
attempts (see Table 1). Logarithms of some of the variables
were taken, but finally only scaled EcnoDiffNum was preprocessed
with logarithmic function. Sample vectors with high
amount of undefined measurements were canceled.
Used
clustering method (see section 3.2) allows using sample vectors
in which some variables are undefined. However, they
are not so useful when the rate of undefined values increases.
Here, sample vectors with 15 or more missing values in 20
variables are canceled.
In Figure 2 the histograms of the most interesting variables
preprocessed using selected methods are visualized.
Some of the variables have quite high peaks in distributions,
but due to the origin of variables no other preprocessing
have been performed. For example, handover failure reasons
pfail ini, pfail ini radio, pfail act radio and pfail act sum up
to unity. However, pfail act is not analyzed because it is zero
all the time in the first data set.

3.2
Clustering
Cluster analysis is used to divide data vectors in groups.
Data vectors falling in same cluster are similar with each
other.
Here, clustering is performed using a two-phase
method [15]. In this method, data vectors are at first used
to train a Self-Organizing Map. Neurons of the SOM adapt
to incoming data so that the input data can in later analysis
be represented by the codebook vectors of neurons. Number
of these codebook vectors is much smaller than the number
of original data vectors. Thus, computational complexity of
the final crisp clustering algorithm is decreased. Another
advantage of using a SOM based two-phase method instead
of direct clustering of data vectors is the visualization capability
of SOM.
In addition to preprocessing, SOM algorithm provides another
possibility to emphasize important properties of data.
Larger weights in distance computation are given to the
most important properties defined by the analyzer. Smaller
or even zero weight can be given to those variables which
are not used in organization of the SOM i.e. in building clusters
. However, values of them can be compared to those with
larger weights using various visualization methods. Weighting
by variable importance can also be built into SOM training
algorithm by utilizing learning distance metrics [7].

cuts, logarithmic preprocessing of r EcnoDNum and
scaling of all variables between [0,1]
The codebook vectors are further clustered using k-means
or some hierarchical clustering method. In this paper, Ward
agglomerative clustering method has been used [4]. In the
beginning of hierarchical clustering, each codebook vector
is a cluster of its own. In the next step, the most similar
clusters are combined and this is continued until all vectors
are in same cluster. The clustering results form a tree structure
called dendrogram. In visualization of a dendrogram,
the clusters combined in each step and the distance between
them are shown. Final clustering is selected by cutting this
tree at certain level. The number of clusters can be selected
manually or some cluster validation index can be utilized
to find the optimum. In this paper, Davies-Bouldin validation
index has been used [3]. Similar clustering methods
have earlier been used in the analysis of both GSM and 3G
network BTSs [9, 11, 13].
As a result of clustering, each data vector is represented
by index of one neuron or by the codebook vector stored in
that neuron. Furthermore, the neuron and the data vectors
the neuron represents belong to same cluster. On basis of
the clustering result, some clusters can be selected for more
specific analysis. Cluster selection is usually done on basis
of found higher values of some critical variables. It is possible
to build a system in which rules are found for clusters
[14, 9] and these are used to select interesting clusters au-tomatically
. Here, interesting clusters are selected manually
on basis of clusterwise variable mean values and histograms.
RESULTS
In this section, handover measurement data is used to
train a Self-Organizing Map of size 17 Ã 12. Then, the codebook
vectors of the SOM are clustered using hierarchical
Ward method. Results of clustering are described and two
clusters are then selected for more specific analysis. Characteristics
of sample vectors falling in those clusters are studied
using histograms.
Only the most interesting variables are used to find the
333
nearest neuron of input data vector. These variables have
nonzero mask which can also be considered as a weighting
factor in a search for the best-matching neuron. Rest of
the variables have zero mask, which means that they can
be visualized and updated using SOM algorithm, but they
do not have an effect on organization of the SOM and on
selection of the cluster in which the sample belongs to.
In Figure 3 all other component planes of SOM with positive
mask are shown, except E

which are shown in Figure 6. In component plane visualization
, distributions of components (or variables) of SOM
codebook vectors are shown. Component values of one codebook
vector are visualized using grayscaling and their locate
in the same position at each plane. For example, values of
one codebook vector are shown at upper right corner in each
plane.

Some component values which were not used in SOM

are adapted to be able to compare their distributions even
with those used in organizing the SOM.

(EcnoDiffNum) is higher in upper part of the SOM. However
, when the latter is scaled by total number of attempts,
higher rate of measurements (r EcnoDNum) is in lower part
of the map. Also, the total number of failuring SHO attempts
(pfail total) is high in upper right corner, but scaling
this by number of attempts tells us that the failure rate
(r fail) in upper right corner is quite moderate. Instead,
higher failure rates exists in both lower corners i.e. in clusters
5 and 8 (see Figure 5).

in Figure 6. When component values of SOM (see Figures
3, 4 and 6) are compared with clustering result (see Figure
5) several types of source target pairs can be found. Most of
them are behaving as expected, but some of them represent
handover attempts with certain type of problems.
Figure 5: SOM which is clustered using hierarchical
Ward method and Davies-Bouldin validation index.
To find out the most interesting clusters of the SOM for
further investigations, distribution of data samples on SOM
is visualized. In Figure 7a hits of all samples on SOM nodes
are visualized and in Figure 7b hits of samples with SHO
failure rate (r fail) larger than 22% are shown. Samples are
distributed all over the map, only some edge nodes have
slightly larger hit rate. Lower part of the map has more hits
when samples with increased failure rate are considered.
In Figure 8 hits of samples which represent two differ-334

ent types of SHO failures are shown. Samples are from cell
pairs in which the rate of selected type of failures is larger
than 75%. However, handover initialization failures due to
some other reason than radio channel resources (i.e. pfail ini
type failures) are obviously more frequent than failures due
to radio channel initialization problems (pfail ini radio type
failures). Cell pairs with SHO failures originating mainly
from these two reasons are mapped on separate clusters.
All SHO failures due to radio channel initialization are in
cluster 9 (see Figures 5 and 8b) and most of all other initialization
failures are in cluster 5 (see Figures 5 and 8a). In
the following, these two clusters are studied in more detail.
In Figures 9 and 10 histograms of samples which belong
to clusters 5 and 9 are shown.
These histograms should
be compared with histograms of whole data set which were
shown in Figure 2. In histograms of cluster 5 (see Figure
9), the average received signal power ratio (av rscp ratio) is
slightly lower than in general. Distributions of three largest

of this cluster can also be seen in Figure 6. All the failing
cell pairs fail in initialization due to other than radio channel
reasons (pfail ini). Total rate of failures is very high
(r fail). One reason for high rate of failures can be that all
the capacity is in use.
In histograms of cluster 9 (see Figure 10), the average received
power ratios are a bit higher than usual, but there are
no samples with high rate of 3dB E

to perform successful SHOs. The rate of initialization failures
in radio channels (pfail ini radio) is higher than usually,
but because only a small part of samples in this cluster have
above mentioned problems the total SHO failure rate is not
higher than usually. The total number of samples or cell
pairs with high rate of initialization failures in SHO is so
small, that it is impossible to make any further inferences
from these clusters. It is possible to check histograms of
only those samples which fulfill the failure rate criteria, but
the number of samples is anyway quite low.

Cell pairs with high rate of radio channel initialization
failures in SHO attempts vary from data set to another,
but without any information on network topology and with
uncomplete information on performed tuning operations, it
is impossible to make any further inferences.

CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, a data analysis method based on a neural
network has been presented. The method is utilized in
data visualization and clustering. The presented method is
only one possibility for finding data clusters. However, the
benefits of the proposed method are the decrease in computational
complexity due to used two-phase clustering algorithm
and the visualization capability of the method. Thus,
it is well suitable for this kind of explorative data analysis.
It is desirable to find clusters with characteristics which
differ from one cluster to another. In the presented method,
selection of variables and variable weighting factors have
been used to find interesting clusters. In the preprocessing
phase, also the number of permitted undefined measurement
values in sample vector has an effect on found clusters.
Sample vectors with high rate of missing values are not so
usable and describable as samples without them. Vectors
with missing values can be used in the SOM training but
the benefit of using them decreases when the rate of undefined
values increases.
In this study, histograms are used both when preprocessing
methods are decided and when an interpretation for the
found clusters are looked for. However, clusters can also be
compared using other visual methods, finding limiting rules
for variable values in clusters or comparing distributions of
variable values in clusters using more sophisticated distribution
comparison measures like Kullback-Leibler divergences
[6].
The results which have been obtained using all available
data sets differ slightly from each other, but due to uncomplete
information on network configuration and parameter
tuning, further inferences cannot be made. However, adding
this information would offer interesting possibilities to continue
this study.
