Entropy and Self-Organization in Multi-Agent Systems
ABSTRACT
Emergent self-organization in multi-agent systems appears to 
contradict the second law of thermodynamics. This paradox has 
been explained in terms of a coupling between the macro level 
that hosts self-organization (and an apparent reduction in 
entropy), and the micro level (where random processes greatly 
increase entropy). Metaphorically, the micro level serves as an 
entropy "sink," permitting overall system entropy to increase 
while sequestering this increase from the interactions where self-organization
is desired. We make this metaphor precise by 
constructing a simple example of pheromone-based coordination, 
defining a way to measure the Shannon entropy at the macro 
(agent) and micro (pheromone) levels, and exhibiting an entropy-based
view of the coordination.
INTRODUCTION
Researchers who construct multi-agent systems must cope with 
the world's natural tendency to disorder. Many applications 
require a set of agents that are individually autonomous (in the 
sense that each agent determines its actions based on its own state 
and the state of the environment, without explicit external 
command), but corporately structured. We want individual local 
decisions to yield coherent global behavior.
Self-organization in natural systems (e.g., human culture, insect 
colonies) is an existence proof that individual autonomy is not 
incompatible with global order. However, widespread human 
experience warns us that building systems that exhibit both 
individual autonomy and global order is not trivial.
Not only agent researchers, but humans in general, seek to impose 
structure and organization on the world around us. It is a universal 
experience that the structure we desire can be achieved only 
through hard work, and that it tends to fall apart if not tended. 
This experience is sometimes summarized informally as 
"Murphy's Law," the observation that anything that can go 
wrong, will go wrong and at the worst possible moment. At the 
root of the ubiquity of disorganizing tendencies is the Second Law
of Thermodynamics, that "energy spontaneously tends to flow 
only from being concentrated in one place to becoming diffused 
and spread out." [9]
Adding energy to a system can overcome the Second Law's 
"spontaneous tendency" and lead to increasing structure. 
However, the way in which energy is added is critical. Gasoline in 
the engines of construction equipment can construct a building 
out of raw steel and concrete, while the same gasoline in a bomb 
can reduce a building to a mass of raw steel and concrete.
Agents are not immune to Murphy. The natural tendency of a 
group of autonomous processes is to disorder, not to organization. 
Adding information to a collection of agents can lead to increased 
organization, but only if it is added in the right way. We will be 
successful in engineering agent-based systems just to the degree 
that we understand the interplay between disorder and order.
The fundamental claim of this paper is that the relation between 
self-organization in multi-agent systems and thermodynamic 
concepts such as the second law is not just a loose metaphor, but 
can provide quantitative, analytical guidelines for designing and 
operating agent systems. We explain the link between these 
concepts, and demonstrate by way of a simple example how they 
can be applied in measuring the behavior of multi-agent systems. 
Our inspiration is a model for self-organization proposed by 
Kugler and Turvey [7], which suggests that the key to reducing 
disorder in a multi-agent system is coupling that system to another 
in which disorder increases. Section 2 reviews this model and 
relates it to the problem of agent coordination. Section 3 describes 
a test scenario that we have devised, inspired by self-organization 
in pheromone systems, and outlines a method for measuring 
entropy in this scenario. Section 4 reports our experimental 
results. Section 5 summarizes our conclusions.

AN ENTROPY MODEL FOR SELF-ORGANIZATION
In the context of biomechanical systems, Kugler and Turvey [7] 
suggest that self-organization can be reconciled with second-law 
tendencies if a system includes multiple coupled levels of 
dynamic activity. Purposeful, self-organizing behavior occurs at 
the macro level. By itself, such behavior would be contrary to the 
second law. However, the system includes a micro level whose 
dynamics generate increasing disorder. Thus the system as a 
whole is increasingly disordered over time. Crucially, the 
behavior of elements at the macro level is coupled to the micro 
level dynamics. To understand this model, we begin with an 
example, then abstract out the underlying dynamics, and finally 
comment on the legitimacy of identifying processes at this level 
with principles from thermodynamics.

2.1  An Example: Pheromones
The parade example of such a system is the self-organization of an 
insect colony (such as the construction of minimal spanning tree 
networks among nests and food sources by ants, or the erection of 
multi-storied structures with regularly spaced pillars and floors by 
tropical termites), through pheromone-based coordination [1, 11]. 
Pheromones are scent markers that insects use in two ways. First, 
they deposit pheromones in the environment to record their state. 
For example, a foraging ant just emerging from the nest in search 
of food might deposit nest pheromone, while an ant that has found 
food and is carrying it will deposit food pheromone. ([15] 
documents use of multiple pheromones by insects.) Second, they 
orient their movements to the gradient of the pheromone field. In 
the example of foraging ants, those seeking food climb the 
gradient of the food pheromone, while those carrying food climb 
the gradient of the nest pheromone. The most realistic models of 
the ants' pheromone-climbing behavior incorporates a stochastic 
element in their movement. That is, they do not follow the 
gradient deterministically, but use its strength to weight a roulette 
wheel from which they determine their movement.
The environment in which pheromones are deposited plays a 
critical role in such a system. It is not passive, but active, and 
performs three information-processing functions with the 
pheromones.
1. It
aggregates deposits of the same flavor of pheromone from
different ants, thus providing a form of data fusion across 
multiple agents at different times, based on their traversal of 
a common location.
2. It
evaporates pheromones over time, thus forgetting obsolete
information. This dynamic is usefully viewed as a novel 
approach to truth maintenance. Conventional knowledge 
bases remember every assertion unless there is cause to 
retract it, and execute truth maintenance processes to detect 
and resolve the conflicts that result when inconsistent 
assertions coexist. Insect systems forget every assertion 
unless it is regularly reinforced.
3.  Evaporation provides a third function, that of disseminating
information from the location at which it was deposited to 
nearby locations. An ant does not have to stumble across the 
exact location at which pheromone was deposited in order to 
access the information it represents, but can sense the 
direction from its current location to the pheromone deposit 
in the form of the gradient of evaporated pheromone 
molecules.
2.2  The Model in Detail
In the Kugler-Turvey model, ants and their movements constitute 
the macro level of the system, while pheromone molecules 
constitute the micro level. The purposeful movement of ants, 
constructing minimal paths among their nests and food sources, 
achieve a reduction in disorder at the macro level, made possible 
because the agents at this level are coupled to the micro level, 
where the evaporation of pheromone molecules under Brownian 
motion results in an overwhelming growth in disorder. As a result, 
the disorder of the overall system increases, in keeping with the 
Second Law, in spite of the emergence of useful order at the 
macro level.
Figure 1 illustrates the interplay among these processes, and how 
this model of agent coordination differs from more classical 
views. Classically, agents are considered to perceive one another 
directly, reason about this perception, and then take rational 
action. The Kugler-Turvey model views coordination as being 
mediated by an environment that agents change by their actions 
(e.g., depositing pheromones), a process known as "stigmergy"  
[4]. Processes in the environment generate structures that the 
agents perceive, thus permitting ordered behavior at the agent 
level. At the same time, these processes increase disorder at the 
micro level, so that the system as a whole becomes less ordered 
over time. 
Research in synthetic pheromones [2, 12, 13] draws directly on 
this model of coordination, but the model is of far broader 
applicability. In a multi-commodity market, individual agents 
follow economic fields generated by myriad individual 
transactions, and self-organization in the demand and supply of a 
particular commodity is supported by an environment that 
distributes resources based on the other transactions in the system. 
The movement of currency in such a system provides similar 
functions to those of pheromones in insect systems. More broadly, 
we hypothesize that a coupling of ordered and disordered systems 
is ubiquitous in robust self-organizing systems, and that the lack 
of such a coupling correlates with architectures that do not meet 
their designers' expectations for emergent cohesiveness.
2.3 A Caveat
At this point, readers with a background in physics and chemistry 
may be uneasy. These disciplines formulated the Second Law 
within a strict context of processes that result in energy changes. 
The fundamental physical measures associated with the second 
law are temperature T, heat Q, and (thermodynamic) entropy S, 
related by the definition

Thus defined, thermodynamic entropy has strong formal

where i ranges over the possible states of the system and p

similarities have led to a widespread appropriation of the notion 
of "entropy" as a measure of macro-level disorder, and of the 
Second Law as describing a tendency of systems to become more 
chaotic. Our approach participates to this appropriation.
It has been objected [8] that such appropriation completely 
ignores the role of energy intrinsic to both thermodynamic 
definitions (via T and dQ in the macro definition and k in the 
micro definition). Such an objection implicitly assumes that 
energy is logically prior to the definition, and that unless 
information processes are defined in terms of energy changes, it is 
illegitimate to identify their changes in entropy with those of 
thermodynamics. An alternative approach to the question would 
argue that in fact the prior concept is not ergs but bits, the 
universe is nothing but a very large cellular automaton with very 
small cells [3, 6], and physics and chemistry can in principle be 
redefined in terms of information-theoretic concepts. Our 
approach is sympathetic with this view. While we are not prepared 
at this point to define the precise correspondence between ergs 
and bits, we believe that physical models are an under-exploited 
resource for understanding computational systems in general and 
multi-agent systems in particular. The fact that the thermodynamic 
and information approaches work in different fundamental units 
(ergs vs. bits) is not a reason to separate them, but a pole star to 
guide research that may ultimately bring them together.
EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
We experiment with these concepts using a simple model of 
pheromone-based behavior. In this section we describe the 
experiment and how one measures entropy over it.
3.1  The Coordination Problem
Consider two agents, one fixed and one mobile, who desire to be 
together. Neither knows the location of the other. The mobile 
agent, or walker, could travel to the destination of the stationary 
one, if it only knew where to go. The stationary agent, or target, 
deposits pheromone molecules at its location. As the pheromone 
molecules diffuse through the environment, they create a gradient 
that the walker can follow. 
Initially, the walker is at (30,30) and the target is at (50,50) in a 
100x100 field. Every time step, the target deposits one molecule 
at (50,50). Both the walker and the pheromone molecules move 
by computing an angle
[0,2] relative to their current heading
and taking a step of constant length (1 for the walker, 2 for the 
pheromone molecule) in the resulting direction. Thus both 
molecules and walkers can be located at any real-valued 
coordinates in the field. Molecules move every cycle of the 
simulation and the walker every five cycles, so altogether the 
molecules move ten times as fast as the walker. Molecules fall off 
of the field when they reach the edge, while the walker bounces 
off the edges.
Molecules choose the heading for their next step from a uniform 
random distribution, and so execute an unbiased random walk. 
The walker computes its heading from two inputs.
1.  It generates a gradient vector
Gr
from its current location to
each molecule within a specified radius
, with magnitude
Equation 4

&lt;
=

i
r

where  r
i
is the distance between the walker and the ith
molecule and g is a "gravitational constant" (currently 1).
2.  It generates a random vector
Rr
with random heading and
length equal to a temperature parameter T.
The vector sum
R
G
r
r +
, normalized to the walker's step length
(1 in these experiments), defines the walker's next step. Including
Rr
in the computation permits us to explore the effectiveness of
different degrees of stochasticity in the walker's movement, 
following the example of natural pheromone systems. 
The state of the walker defines the macro state of the system, 
while the states of the molecules define the micro state. This 
model can easily be enhanced in a number of directions, including 
adding multiple walkers and multiple targets, and permitting 
walkers and targets to deposit pheromone molecules of various 
flavors. The simple configuration is sufficient to demonstrate our 
techniques and their potential for understanding how the walker 
finds the target.
3.2 Measuring Entropy
Computing the Shannon or Information Entropy defined in 
Equation 3 requires that we measure  
1.  the set of states accessible to the system and  
2.  the probability of finding the system in each of those states.
3.2.1  Measuring the Number of System States
In most computational systems, the discreteness of digital 
computation makes counting system states straightforward 
(though the number of possible states is extremely high). We have 
purposely defined the movement of our walker and molecules in 
continuous space to highlight the challenge of counting discrete 
system states in an application embedded in the physical world 
(such as a robotic application). Our approach is to superimpose a 
grid on the field, and define a state on the basis of the populations 
of the cells of the grid.  
We can define state, and thus entropy, in terms either of location 
or direction. Location-based state is based on a single snapshot of 
the system, while direction-based state is based on how the system 
has changed between successive snapshots. Each approach has an 
associated gridding technique. 
For location-based entropy, we divide the field with a grid. Figure 
2 shows a 2x2 grid with four cells, one spanning each quarter of 
the field. The state of this system is a four-element vector 
reporting the number of molecules in each cell (in the example, 
reading row-wise from upper left, &lt;1,1,3,2&gt;. The number of 
possible states in an nxn grid with m particles is n
2m
.  The
parameters in location-based gridding are the number of divisions 
in each direction, their orientation, and the origin of the grid.
126
Rectangular grids are easiest to manage computationally, but one 
could also tile the plane with hexagons. 
For direction-based entropy, we center a star on the previous 
location of each particle and record the sector of the star into 
which the particle is found at the current step. Figure 3 shows a 
four-rayed star with a two particles. The state of the system is a 
vector with one element for each particle in some canonical order. 
Counting sectors clockwise from the upper left, the state of this 
example is &lt;2,3&gt;. The number of possible states with an n-pointed
star and m particles is mn. The parameters in direction-based
gridding are the number of rays in the star and the rotation 
of the star about its center. 
In both techniques, the analysis depends critically on the 
resolution of the grid (the parameter n) and its origin and 
orientation (for location) or rotation (for direction). 
To understand the dependency on n, consider two extremes. If n is 
very large, the chance of two distributions of particles on the field 
having the same state is vanishingly small. For N distributions,
each will be a distinct state, each state will have equal probability 
1/N, and the entropy will be log(N). This state of affairs is clearly 
not informative. At the other extreme, n = 1, all distributions 
represent the same state, which therefore occurs with probability 
1, yielding entropy 0, again not informative. We choose the 
gridding resolution empirically by observing the length scales 
active in the system as it operates. 
To understand the dependency on origin/orientation or rotation, 
consider two particles in the same cell. After they move, will they 
still be in the same cell (keeping entropy the same) or in different 
cells (increasing entropy)? Exactly the same movements of the 
two particles could yield either result, depending on how the grid 
is registered with the field. We follow Gutowitz's technique [5] of 
measuring the entropy with several different origins and taking the 
minimum, thus minimizing entropy contributions resulting from 
the discrete nature of the grid.
3.2.2  Measuring the Probabilities
In principle, one could compute the probability of different 
system states analytically. This approach would be arduous even 
for our simple system, and completely impractical for a more 
complex system. We take a Monte Carlo approach instead. We 
run the system repeatedly. At each step in time, we estimate the 
probability of each observed state by counting the number of 
replications in which that state was observed. The results reported 
here are based on 30 replications.  
Shannon entropy has a maximum value of log(N) for N different 
states, achieved when each state is equally probable. To eliminate 
this dependence on N, we normalize the entropies we report by 
dividing by log(N) (in our case, log(30)), incidentally making the 
choice of base of logarithms irrelevant.
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We report the behavior of entropy first in the micro system, then 
in the unguided and guided macro system, and finally in the 
complete system.
4.1  Entropy in the Micro System
Figure 4 shows locational entropy in the micro system (the 
pheromone molecules), computed from a 5x5 grid. Entropy 
increases with time until it saturates at 1. The more molecules 
enter the system and the more they disperse throughout the field, 
the higher the entropy grows. Increasing the grid resolution has no 
effect on the shape of this increase, but reduces the time to 
saturation, because the molecules must spread out from a single

location and the finer the grid, the sooner they can generate a 
large number of different states. 
Directional entropy also increases with time to saturation. This 
result (not plotted) can be derived analytically. The molecule 
population increases linearly with time until molecules start 
reaching the edge. Then the growth slows, and eventually reaches 
0. Let M be the population of the field at equilibrium, and 
consider all M molecules being located at (50,50) through the 
entire run. Initially, all are stationary, and each time step one 
additional molecule is activated. Then the total number of 
possible system states for a 4-star is 4M, but the number actually 
sampled during the period of linear population growth is 4t, since 
the stationary molecules do not generate any additional states. 
Thus the entropy during the linear phase is log(4t)/log(4M). As 
the growth becomes sublinear, the entropy asymptotically 
approaches 1, as with locational entropy.
4.2  Entropy in the Unguided Macro System
Figure 5 shows the path of a walker uncoupled to the micro 
system (when the target is emitting no pheromone molecules). 
With no coupling to the micro field, the walker is just a single 
molecule executing a random walk. Figure 6 shows that locational 
entropy for this walker increases over time, reflecting the 
increased number of cells accessible to the walker as its random 
walk takes it farther from its base. The grid size (15 divisions in 
each direction) is chosen on the basis of observations of the 
guided walker, discussed in the next section.
The directional entropy (not plotted) is constant at 1, since the 
walker chooses randomly at each step from all available 
directions.
4.3  Entropy in Guided Macro System
Now we provide the walker with a micro field by emitting 
pheromone molecules from the target. Figure 7 shows the path 
followed by a typical walker with radius
= 20 and T = 0. This
path has three distinct parts. 
¬∑  Initially, the walker wanders randomly around its origin at
(30,30), until the wavefront of molecules diffusing from 
(50,50) encounters its radius. In this region, the walker has 
no guidance, because no molecules are visible.
¬∑  Once the walker begins to sense molecules, it moves rather
directly from the vicinity of (30,30) to (50,50), following the 
pheromone gradient.
¬∑  When it arrives at (50,50), it again receives no guidance from
the molecules, because they are distributed equally in all 
directions. So it again meanders.
The clouds of wandering near the start and finish have diameters 
in the range of 5 to 10, suggesting a natural grid between 20x20 
and 10x10. We report here experiments with a 15x15 grid. 
Because of their initial random walk around their origin, walkers 
in different runs will be at different locations when they start to 
move, and will follow slightly different paths to the target (Figure 
8).

Figure 8. Ensemble of Guided Walkers (
= 20, T = 0)
128
The dots in Figure 9 and Figure 10 show the directional and 
locational entropies across this ensemble of guided walkers as a 
function of time. The solid line in each case plots the normalized 
median distance from the walkers to the target (actual maximum 
28), while the dashed line plots the normalized median number of 
molecules visible to the walkers (actual maximum 151). The lines 
show how changes in entropy and reduction in distance to the 
target are correlated with the number of molecules that the walker 
senses at any given moment. 
At the beginning and end of the run, when the walkers are 
wandering without guidance, directional entropy is 1, 
corresponding to a random walk. During the middle portion of the 
run, when the walker is receiving useful guidance from the micro 
level, the entropy drops dramatically. As the temperature 
parameter T is increased in the range 50 to 100, the bottom of the 
entropy well rises, but the overall shape remains the same (plot 
not shown). 
The locational entropy presents a different story. The 
minimization method for avoiding discreteness artifacts has the 
effect of selecting at each time step the offset that best centers the 
cells on the walkers. At the beginning of the run and again at the 
end, most walkers are close together, and fall within the same cell 
(because we chose a cell size comparable to these clouds). 
Walkers leave the starting cloud at different times, since those 
closer to the target sense the pheromones sooner, and follow
different paths, depending on where they were when the 
pheromone reached them. Thus they spread out during this 
movement phase, and cluster together again once they reach the 
target. The effect of raising T to 100 on locational entropy is that 
the right end of the curve rises until the curve assumes a similar 
shape (plot not shown) to Figure 6. 
Comparison of Figure 6 and Figure 10 shows that though the 
directed portion of the walker's movement has higher entropy 
than the undirected portions, coupling the walker to the micro 
level does reduce the walker's overall entropy. Even at its 
maximum, the entropy of the guided walker is much lower than 
that of the random one, demonstrating the basic dynamics of the 
Kugler-Turvey model. 
The different behavior of locational and directional entropy is 
instructive. Which is more orderly: a randomly moving walker, or 
one guided by pheromones? The expected location of a random 
walker is stationary (though with a non-zero variance), while that 
of a guided walker is non-stationary. In terms of location, the 
random walker is thus more regular, and the location entropy 
reflects this. However, the movement of the guided walker is more 
orderly than that of the random walker, and this difference is 
reflected in the directional entropy. This difference highlights the 
importance of paying attention to dynamical aspects of agent 
behavior. Our intuition that the guided walker is more orderly 
than the random one is really an intuition about the movement of 
this walker, not its location.
4.4  Entropy in the Overall System
Central to the Kugler-Turvey model is the assertion that entropy 
increase at the micro level is sufficient to ensure entropy increase 
in the overall system even in the presence of self-organization and 
concomitant entropy reduction at the micro level. Our experiment 
illustrates this dynamic. As illustrated in Figure 4, by time 60, 
normalized entropy in the micro system has reached the maximum 
level of 1, indicating that each of the 30 replications of the 
experiment results in a distinct state. If each replication is already 
distinct on the basis of the locations of the pheromone molecules 
alone, adding additional state elements (such as the location of the 
walker) cannot cause two replications to become the same. Thus 
by time 60 the normalized entropy of the entire system must also 
be at a maximum. In particular, decreases in macro entropy, such 
as the decrease in locational entropy from time 80 on seen in 
Figure 10, do not reduce the entropy of the overall system. 
One may ask whether the reduction in macro (walker) entropy is 
causally related to the increase in micro entropy, or just 
coincidental. After all, a static gradient of pheromone molecules 
would guide the walker to the target just as effectively, but would 
be identical in every run, and so exhibit zero entropy. This 
argument neglects whatever process generates the static gradient 
in the first place. An intelligent observer could produce the 
gradient, but then the behavior of the system would hardly be 
"self-organizing." In our scenario, the gradient emerges as a 
natural consequence of a completely random process, the random 
walk of the pheromone molecules emerging from the target. The 
gradient can then reduce the entropy of a walker at the macro 
level, but the price paid for this entropy reduction is the increase 
in entropy generated by the random process that produces and 
maintains the gradient.

One may also ask whether our hypothesis requires a quantitative 
relation between entropy loss at the macro level and entropy gain 
at the micro level. A strict entropy balance is not required; the 
micro level might generate more entropy than the macro level 
loses. In operational terms, the system may have a greater capacity 
for coordination than a particular instantiation exploits. What is 
required is that the entropy increase at the micro level be 
sufficient to cover the decrease at the macro level, and this we 
have shown.

SUMMARY
To be effective, multi-agent systems must yield coordinated 
behavior from individually autonomous actions. Concepts from 
thermodynamics (in particular, the Second Law and entropy) have 
been invoked metaphorically to explain the conditions under 
which coordination can emerge. Our work makes this metaphor 
more concrete and derives several important insights from it. 
¬∑  This metaphor can be made quantitative, through simple state
partitioning methods and Monte Carlo simulation.
¬∑  These methods show how coordination can arise through
coupling the macro level (in which we desire agent self-organization
with a concomitant decrease in entropy) to an 
entropy-increasing process at a micro level (e.g., pheromone 
evaporation). Our demonstration focuses on synthetic 
pheromones for the sake of expositional simplicity, but we 
believe that the same approach would be fruitful for 
understanding self-organization with other mechanisms of 
agent coordination, such as market systems.
¬∑  This confirmation of the Kugler-Turvey model encourages us
as agent designers to think explicitly in terms of macro and 
micro levels, with agent behaviors at the macro level coupled 
in both directions (causally and perceptually) to entropy-increasing
processes at the micro level.
¬∑  Some form of pheromone or currency is a convenient
mechanism for creating such an entropy-increasing process.
¬∑  Researchers must distinguish between static and dynamic
order in a multi-agent system. We have exhibited a system 
that appears intuitively to be self-organizing, and shown that 
the measure of order underlying this intuition is dynamic 
rather than sta
