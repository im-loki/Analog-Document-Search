[('Marble cutting with single point cutting tool and diamond segments\nAn investigation has been undertaken into the frame sawing with diamond blades.\nThe kinematic behaviour of the frame sawing process is discussed. Under\ndifferent cutting conditions, cutting and indenting-cutting tests are\ncarried out by single point cutting tools and single diamond segments.\nThe results indicate that the depth of cut per diamond grit increases\nas the blades move forward. Only a few grits per segment can remove the\nmaterial in the cutting process. When the direction of the stroke\nchanges, the cutting forces do not decrease to zero because of the\nresidual plastic deformation beneath the diamond grits. The plastic\ndeformation and fracture chipping of material are the dominant removal\nprocesses, which can be explained by the fracture theory of brittle\nmaterial indentation\n', ['marble cutting', 'single point cutting tool', 'diamond segments', 'frame sawing', 'kinematic behaviour', 'cutting tests', 'indenting-cutting tests', 'residual plastic deformation', 'fracture chipping', 'removal processes', 'fracture theory', 'brittle material indentation', 'computerised numerical control', 'cutting', 'diamond', 'kinematics', 'machining', 'plastic deformation']), ('On trajectory and force tracking control of constrained mobile manipulators\nwith parameter uncertainty\nStudies the trajectory and force tracking control problem of mobile\nmanipulators subject to holonomic and nonholonomic constraints with\nunknown inertia parameters.
