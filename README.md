# Final Year Project

This file will be updated with any changes as the project proceeds. Please make sure you are up to date with the new requirements regularly. Please conform to the coding standards to have an efficient collaboration.

Always commit the code in a branch other than the master. The changes will be merged if it is properly working. This is a very important rule which is not to be broken for everyone's good.

# Libraries Required

scikit-image

# Styleguide

Install "pylint" for checking the consistency of the coding style for all the python scripts. To install you can use the following command,

pip install pylint

or,

conda install pylint

depending on the python environment installed on your machine.

The working procedure of a linter is as follows,

pylint <program_name>

This command will print all the inconsistencies with the standard styleguide. Fix all the issues before committing the code.
